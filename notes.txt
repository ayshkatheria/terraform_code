Resources:

Resources: EC2 & S3
Provider: AWS
Variables: EC2 & S3 names, AMI, etc.
Backend State File: S3 & DynamoDB
AWS Configuration
Steps:

📝 We will create a terraform.tf file, define the terraform block, and specify the "required providers" and the "backend block for S3."
🛠️ Let's create the S3 bucket and define the S3 bucket name in the variables file.
💻 Let's create the EC2 instance, define two resources—one for the key pair and the other for the instance—and pass the variables in the file.
📦 Let's create DynamoDB for the backend state file table.
Note:

First, create the S3 bucket for the backend block, then create DynamoDB for lock files.
It's best to create a separate backend file instead of defining the backend block within the terraform block.
