Scenario:

🌍 Create and maintain a remote backend for the "tfstate" file.
🏗️ Use "Module" to create infrastructure for "DEV", "PROD", and "Test/Stage".
⚙️ The infrastructure should include:
2 EC2 instances
1 S3 bucket
1 DynamoDB table
Steps:

🛠️ Let's first create a backend file: It will contain one S3 bucket for maintaining the ".tfstate" file and a DynamoDB table for the lock file.
📝 Create the terraform.tf file and define only the terraform block.
🌐 Create a provider file and declare the AWS region.
🏗️ Now, let's create the infrastructure under the my_infra folder:
my_server.tf
my_bucket.tf
my_table.tf
variables.tf
⚡ Now, let's create a main.tf file to pass all the requirements.
